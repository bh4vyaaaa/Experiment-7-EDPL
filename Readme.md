#Experiment: Study of Iterative Structures (Loops) in Python
##Aim :The primary aim of this practical is to study and implement different types of loops in Python. The experiment focuses on understanding how to automate repetitive tasks and solve complex logic problems using iterative structures.

Objects :
Our main objectives were:

To master the While Loop for condition-based iteration.
To master the For Loop for range-based and sequence-based iteration.
To understand Nested Loops for solving multi-dimensional problems like matrix multiplication and combinations.
To learn loop control statements like break and continue to modify the flow of an iteration.
Theory and Concepts Used
1. The While Loop
A while loop is used when we want to repeat a block of code as long as a specific condition is true. In this practical, I used it for simple counting and for reversing strings to check for palindromes. It is essential when the number of iterations isn't known beforehand.

2. The For Loop
The for loop is used to iterate over a sequence (like a list or a string) or a range of numbers. It is the most common loop used in Python for fixed-length iterations, such as generating Armstrong numbers within a specific range.

3. Loop Control: The continue Statement
Sometimes we need to skip a specific part of a loop without stopping the whole thing. The continue statement allows the program to jump back to the start of the loop for the next iteration, skipping any code written below it for that specific turn.

4. Nested Loops
When a loop is placed inside another loop, it is called a nested loop. This is a powerful concept used in this experiment for:

Matrix Multiplication: Iterating through rows and columns.
Combinations: Generating all possible sets of three digits.
Pattern Printing: Managing spaces and stars to create a diamond shape.

If valid, take user input to fill both matrices using nested loops.
Create a result matrix filled with zeros.

Use a triple-nested loop  to multiply elements and add them to the result matrix.
Print the final result in a structured grid format.Conclusion
Through this experiment, I have gained a deep understanding of how loops work in Python. I successfully implemented simple counters, conditional skips, and complex nested structures for matrix math. Understanding loops is fundamental to programming because it allows us to handle large amounts of data and perform repetitive calculations efficiently.
